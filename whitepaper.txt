SPAMEK — Whitepaper
Introduction
In the chaotic world of crypto, noise dominates signal.
Fake airdrops, memecoins with no liquidity, rugs disguised as “utility,” and armies of bots shouting into the void.
We created SPAMEK to bring clarity — and a little resistance — to the madness.

SPAMEK is not just a bot.
It’s a character, a scanner, and a storyteller:
an old CRT monitor with burned-in pixels, dusty cables, and a mission — to hunt the noise and expose the lies in memecoin culture.

Vision
We believe memes can have meaning.
SPAMEK exists to scan, analyze, and document the memetic toxicity of Solana and other chains — in an interactive, funny, and sometimes unsettling way.
Our mission is twofold:

Entertain the community with lore, scans, gifs, and voting.

Educate users by exposing on-chain scams and low-quality tokens.

Features
🧪 Scanning

/scan [address] — Scan any token address and get:

Memetic Toxicity level

🗳️ Voting

Token Utility
$SPAM is the native token of the SPAMEK project.
It serves both as a badge of membership and fuel for the lore.
Utility includes:

Influence in voting and lore outcomes

🚧 Q4 2025 — Full DEX & Solana API integration + Web dashboard

Philosophy
SPAMEK does not promise airdrops or false utility.
It thrives on honesty, humor, and community involvement.
We embrace the chaos of crypto culture but aim to expose its darker corners.

Conclusion
SPAMEK is more than a bot.
It’s a voice in the noise — flickering but relentless.
We invite you to join the hunt, participate in the lore, and help SPAMEK clean up the memetic wasteland.
